- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development (Front-End in particular with a bit of Back-End)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React (+ constantly catching up with JavaScript)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which would be appropriate to my current level (HTML/CSS/JS/React/Router/Redux)
- 📫 How to reach me: currently I'm mostly present on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dimterion) and also write stories on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dimterion)
